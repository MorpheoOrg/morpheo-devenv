# Development Environment for the Morpheo project

This repository holds a docker-compose environment for the Morpheo project.

It also contains a Makefile that detects changes in those repositories and
automatically rebuilds what need to be rebuilt (and that only) and updates the
dev. environment.

## Setup
#### Requirements
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version >= 1.8
* [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) the official Go dependency management tool. You can install it by running `go get github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

#### Set the directory tree
To build and launch the Morpheo services, the development environment searches for their respective git repositories **in the parent directory**. Consequently, the directory architecture should be like this:
```
$GOPATH/src/github.com/MorpheoOrg
                                |___morpheo-devenv
                                |___morpheo-compute
                                |___morpheo-storage
                                |___morpheo-go-packages
                                |___morpheo-orchestrator

```


To set everything up, you can run the following in your `$GOPATH/src/github.com` directory:
```
mkdir MorpheoOrg &&
cd MorpheoOrg &&
git clone https://github.com/MorpheoOrg/morpheo-devenv.git &&
git clone https://github.com/MorpheoOrg/morpheo-compute.git &&
git clone https://github.com/MorpheoOrg/morpheo-storage.git &&
git clone https://github.com/MorpheoOrg/morpheo-go-packages.git &&
git clone https://github.com/MorpheoOrg/morpheo-orchestrator.git
```


#### Start the Development Environment
Once the directory architecture is in place, you can launch the Morpheo Environment just by running in the morpheo-devenv repository:
```
make up
```

The first time may last quite a while, as all the libraries and the docker images need to be pulled.

Once `make up` has run, you can check with your favourite tool (such as `ctop`) that the containers have been properly launched. To see Morpheo in action, run the integration tests.

Note that the exposed ports for the services can be changed in the Makefile, the default one being:
* Storage: 8081
* Compute: 8082
* Orchestrator: 8083

## Usage
GNU Make is used to interact with the devenv:

* `make up`: **start the devenv**, by updating the vendor, building the binaries, and running a `docker-compose up`
* `make stop`: **stop all the containers**, by running `docker-compose stop`
* `make logs`: **show the logs of the main containers**, by running `docker-compose logs`
* `make down`: **delete all the containers**, by running `docker-compose down`
* `make clean`: **delete all the containers and the data**, including storage files, postgres and mongo data
* `make tests`: **run the integration tests**


Note that `make up` does the following when needed:

1. Update *compute vendor* and *storage vendor* folder with `dep ensure`.
2. Replace the folder `morpheo-go-packages` in *compute vendor* and *storage vendor* by your local folder in the parent directory `MorpheoOrg/morpheo-go-packages`. This step is crucial for development, as `dep` fetches the latest github release of morpheo-go-packages and **not** your local repository. Consequently, if you are working on go-packages and you want to tests the change you have made, this replacement is necessary.
3. Build the Compute and Storage Go binaries
4. Run `docker-compose up` with variables set in the Makefile to build the docker images and launch the Morpheo services in containers


## Tests
The Devenv provide a script test/integration.go that tests that the whole plateform works.

##### Setup
You will need some real data and a `.yaml` file containing the metadata to perform the test. The paths of the data folder and the `.yaml` file can be specified in the Makefile.

To perform the tests, you can use the `fixtures.yaml` in `/tests/`, and download the associated data from Google Cloud Storage:
```
cd morpheo-devenv/data   # default path for the fixtures data
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/morpheo-storage/fixtures/fixtures.tar.gz
tar -zxvf fixtures.tar.gz   # to un-tar-gz the fixtures
```

##### Usage
```
make tests
```
