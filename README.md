Development environment for the Morpheo project
===============================================

This repository holds a docker-compose environment for the Morpheo project. To use it,
the parent directory must have the git repositories pf go-packages, storage and compute.

It also contains a Makefile that detects changes in those repositories and
automatically rebuilds what needs to be rebuilt (and that only) and updates the
dev. environment. Interpreted code (Python, frontend code) should be mounted as
a volume directly in the appropriate container, therefore you should have to
rebuild only when you changes dependencies.

Getting started
---------------

Make sure `make`, `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed on your machine
before going any further.

#### TODO: detail how to do this

Building a Golang binary
