Development environment for the Morpheo project
===============================================

This repository holds a docker-compose environment for the Morpheo project. It
embeds all the different projects' code and libs as Git submodules. You can hack
on the project's code directly in Git submodules. For developers with direct
push right to this repository, please be sure to read and understand 100% of the
[Git documentation about submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for God's sake !

It also contains a Makefile that detects changes in Git submodules and
automatically rebuilds what needs to be rebuilt (and that only) and updates the
dev. environment. Interpreted code (Python, frontend code) should be mounted as
a volume directly in the appropriate container, therefore you should have to
rebuild only when you changes dependencies.

Getting started
---------------

Make sure `make`, `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed on your machine
before going any further.
